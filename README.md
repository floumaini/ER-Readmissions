## ER Readmissions for diabetic patients

## Scope 

More than 30 million of Americans have diabetes and 10% of these patients are readmitted to the ER within 30 days. Returning to a hospital within a short period of time after being discharged is costly to the healthcare system(total readmissions cost $41.3 billion in 2011). Avoidable reasons for ER readmission include:

- Confusion about the prescribed medication and dosage.
- Miscommunication by hospital staff of important information such as test results.
- Improper follow-up care after release. 

Hospital readmissions are often used to measure quality of care in the healthcare system. The affordable care act established the Medicare Hospital Readmissions Reduction program to impose financial penalties on hospitals with excessive readmissions and pressure them to lower the readmission rates.
My goal in this project is to predict whether a patient with diabates discharged from a hospital will return within 30 days as an emergency admit.
